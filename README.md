#### Problem Statement
Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money theyâ€™ve spent and also which menu items are their favourite. Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalised experience for his loyal customers.

He plans on using these insights to help him decide whether he should expand the existing customer loyalty program - additionally he needs help to generate some basic datasets so his team can easily inspect the data without needing to use SQL.

Danny has provided you with a sample of his overall customer data due to privacy issues - but he hopes that these examples are enough for you to write fully functioning SQL queries to help him answer his questions!

Danny has shared with you 3 key datasets for this case study:

- sales
- menu
- members

## Question and Solution
 1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?


```
SELECT 
  sales.customer_id, 
  SUM(menu.price) AS total_sales
FROM dannys_diner.sales
INNER JOIN dannys_diner.menu
  ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
GROUP BY sales.customer_id
ORDER BY sales.customer_id ASC; 
```
 **Selecting Data:**
- ```sales.customer_id```: Selects the ```customer_id``` from the ```sales``` table.
- ```SUM(menu.price) AS total_sales```: Calculates the sum of the ```price``` from the ```menu``` table for each customer and assigns it the alias ```total_sales```.

**Joining Tables:**
- ```FROM dannys_diner.sales```: Specifies the ```sales``` table from the ```dannys_diner``` database schema.
- ```INNER JOIN dannys_diner.menu ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id```: This joins the ```sales``` and ```menu``` tables based on the ```product_id```. This ensures the ```price``` information from the ```menu``` table is associated with the corresponding sales data in the ```sales``` table.

**Grouping Data:**
- ```GROUP BY sales.customer_id```: This groups the results by ```customer_id```. This ensures the ```SUM(menu.price)``` is calculated for each unique  customer. Without ```GROUP BY```, the total sales would be summed for all customers combined.
**Ordering Results:**
- ```ORDER BY sales.customer_id ASC```: This orders the final results by ```customer_id``` in ascending order. This provides a clear organization of the data from the perspective of customer IDs.

**Result**
- Customer A spent $76.
- Customer B spent $74.
- Customer C spent $36.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
**2.How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?**
```
SELECT
customer_id, 
COUNT(DISTINCT order_date) AS visit_count
FROM dannys_diner.sales
GROUP BY customer_id;
```
**Selecting Data:**
- ```customer_id```: Selects the ```customer_id``` from the ```sales``` table.
- ```COUNT(DISTINCT order_date) AS visit_count```:
- ```COUNT```: This function counts the number of rows.
- ```DISTINCT order_date```: This ensures that only unique ```order_date``` values are counted. It removes duplicates,so a customer visiting on the same day is counted only once.
- ```AS visit_count```: This assigns an alias ```visit_count``` to the result of the ```COUNT``` function.
**Grouping Data:**
```GROUP BY customer_id```: This groups the results by ```customer_id```. This ensures the ```COUNT(DISTINCT order_date)```is calculated for each unique customer. Without ```GROUP BY```, the total number of visits would be a single value for all customers combined.

**Result**
| customer_id	| visit_count   |
| ----------- | ------------- |
| A             | 4           |
| B             | 6           |
| C             | 2           |

-------------------------------------------------------------------
#### 3. What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?
```
WITH ordered_sales AS (
  SELECT 
    sales.customer_id, 
    sales.order_date, 
    menu.product_name,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (
      PARTITION BY sales.customer_id 
      ORDER BY sales.order_date) AS rank
  FROM dannys_diner.sales
  INNER JOIN dannys_diner.menu
    ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
)

SELECT 
  customer_id, 
  product_name
FROM ordered_sales
WHERE rank = 1
GROUP BY customer_id, product_name;
```
- ```SELECT```: This clause selects the desired columns for the temporary result set.
  - ```sales.customer_id```: Customer ID from the sales table.
  - ```sales.order_date```: Order date from the sales table.
  -  ```menu.product_name```: Product name from the menu table (joined based on ```sales.product_id```).
  -  ```DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY sales.customer_id ORDER BY sales.order_date) AS rank```:
  -  ```DENSE_RANK()```: This window function assigns a rank (position) to each row within a partition.
  -  ```PARTITION BY sales.customer_id```: This partitions the data by ```customer_id```. This ensures ranking is done for each customer independently.
  -  ```ORDER BY sales.order_date```: This orders the rows within each partition by order_date in ascending order.
  -  ```AS rank```: This assigns an alias rank to the result of the - ```DENSE_RANK()``` function.
- ```FROM dannys_diner.sales```: Specifies the sales table from the database schema.
- ```INNER JOIN dannys_diner.menu ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id```: Joins the ```sales``` and ```menu``` tables based on - ```product_id``` to retrieve corresponding product names.
** Main Query:**
- ```SELECT```: Selects the desired columns from the ```ordered_sales``` CTE.
  -  ```customer_id```: From the ```ordered_sales``` CTE.
  -  ```product_name```: From the ```ordered_sales``` CTE.
- ```FROM ordered_sales```: References the previously defined CTE (```ordered_sales```).
- ```WHERE rank = 1```: Filters the results within the CTE to include only rows where ```rank``` is 1. This selects the row with the earliest ```order_date ```(first purchase) for each customer based on the ranking.
- ```GROUP BY customer_id, product_name:``` This might seem unnecessary here because the ```WHERE``` clause already filters by ```rank = 1```. However, it ensures proper output formatting, especially if there might be duplicate ```product_name``` entries for the same customer on the first purchase date (e.g., two of the same item)

**Result**
| customer_id | product_name |
| ----------- | ------------ |
| A	          | curry        |
| A 	         | sushi        |
| B           | curry        |
| C	          | ramen        |

-------------------------------------------------------------------
**4.What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?**
```
SELECT 
  menu.product_name,
  COUNT(sales.product_id) AS most_purchased_item
FROM dannys_diner.sales
INNER JOIN dannys_diner.menu
  ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
GROUP BY menu.product_name
ORDER BY most_purchased_item DESC
LIMIT 1;
```
 ** Selecting Data:**
- ```menu.product_name```: Selects the product name from the menu table.
- ```COUNT(sales.product_id) AS most_purchased_item```:
  -  ```COUNT```: This function counts the number of rows.
  -  s```ales.product_id```: This specifies the column to be counted (number of times each product ID appears in sales).
  -  ```AS most_purchased_item```: This assigns an alias ```most_purchased_item``` to the result of the ```COUNT``` function.
**Joining Tables:**
- ```FROM dannys_diner.sales```: Specifies the sales table from the database schema.
- ```INNER JOIN dannys_diner.menu ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id```: Joins the ```sales``` and ```menu``` tables based on ```product_id``` to associate product names with corresponding sales data.
**Grouping Data:**
- ```GROUP BY menu.product_name```: This groups the results by ```product_name```. This ensures the ```COUNT(sales.product_id)``` is calculated for each unique product. Without ```GROUP BY```, the total count would be for all products combined.
**Ordering and Limiting Results:**
- ```ORDER BY most_purchased_item DESC```: Orders the results by ```most_purchased_item``` in descending order (most popular first).
- ```LIMIT 1```: Limits the retrieved results to only the first row (the product with the highest count).

**Result**
|product_name	|most_purchased_item |
| ----------- | ------------------ |
| ramen	      |        8           |

-------------------------------------------------------------------
**5.Which item was the most popular for each customer?**
```
WITH most_populor_item AS (
	SELECT sales.customer_id, menu.product_name,
	COUNT(menu.product_id) AS order_count,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER(
      PARTITION BY sales.customer_id 
      ORDER BY COUNT(sales.customer_id) DESC) AS rank
  FROM dannys_diner.sales
  JOIN dannys_diner.menu
  	ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
  GROUP BY sales.customer_id, menu.product_name
)
SELECT 
  customer_id, 
  product_name, 
  order_count
FROM most_populor_item 
WHERE rank = 1;
```
This code snippet utilizes a Common Table Expression (CTE) to identify the most popular item for each customer at Danny's Diner. Here's a breakdown:
 **Common Table Expression (CTE):**
- ```WITH most_popular_item AS ( ... )```: This defines a CTE named ```most_popular_item```. It acts as a temporary named result set used within the main query.
Within the CTE:
- ```SELECT```: This clause selects the desired columns for the temporary result set.
  -  ```customer_id, product_name, COUNT(*) AS order_count```: These columns are essential to identify the most popular item for each customer.
  -  ```COUNT(*) AS order_count```: Counts all purchases for each product by customer.
  -  ```DENSE_RANK()``` assigns ranks based on these counts within each customer group.
- ```FROM dannys_diner.sales```: Specifies the ```sales``` table from the database schema.
- ```JOIN dannys_diner.menu ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id```: Joins the ```sales``` and ```menu``` tables based on ```product_id``` to retrieve corresponding product names.
- ```GROUP BY sales.customer_id, menu.product_name```: Groups the results by both ```customer_id``` and ```product_name```. This ensures ```order_count``` is calculated for each unique combination of customer and product.

 **Main Query:**
- ```SELECT```: Selects the desired columns from the ```most_popular_item``` CTE.
 -  ```customer_id```: From the ```most_popular_item```CTE.
  -  ```product_name: From the ```most_popular_item``` CTE.
  -  ```order_count```: From the ```most_popular_item``` CTE.
- ```FROM most_popular_item```: References the previously defined CTE (most_popular_item).
- ```WHERE rank = 1```: Filters the results within the CTE to include only rows where rank is 1. This selects the product with the highest ```order_count``` (most frequent purchase) for each customer.

**Result**
|customer_id	| product_name	| order_count|
|------------|--------------|------------|
| A	         |  ramen	      | 3          |
| B	         |  ramen	      | 2          |
| B	         |  curry	      | 2          |
| B	         |  sushi	      | 2          |
| C	         |  ramen	      | 3          |

-------------------------------------------------------------------
**6.Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?**

```
WITH joined_as_member AS (
  SELECT
    members.customer_id, 
    sales.product_id,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER(
      PARTITION BY members.customer_id
      ORDER BY sales.order_date) AS row_num
  FROM dannys_diner.members
  JOIN dannys_diner.sales
    ON members.customer_id = sales.customer_id
    AND sales.order_date > members.join_date
)

SELECT 
  customer_id, 
  product_name 
FROM joined_as_member
JOIN dannys_diner.menu
  ON joined_as_member.product_id = menu.product_id
WHERE row_num = 1
ORDER BY customer_id ASC;
```
This code effectively finds the first item purchased by each customer after joining Danny's Diner. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

**Common Table Expression (CTE):**

- ```joined_as_member``` CTE identifies sales for members after their join date.
- It joins the ```members``` and ```sales``` tables based on ```customer_id```.
- Filters for sales where ```order_date``` is greater than ```join_date```.
- Assigns a sequential number (```row_num```) to each sale record within each customer group (```ordered by order_date```).
**Main Query:**

- ```Selects customer_id``` and ```product_name``` from the ```oined_as_member CTE``` and ```menu``` table, respectively.
  -  Joins the CTE with the ```menu``` table using ```product_id``` to retrieve product names.
- Filters for rows where ```row_num = 1``` (selecting the first purchase for each customer).
- Orders the results by ```customer_id``` in ascending order.
**Result**
| customer_id	| product_name |
| A           | ramen        |
| B           | sushi        |

---------------------------------
**7.Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?**
```
-- 7. Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?


WITH joined_as_member AS (
  SELECT
    members.customer_id, 
    sales.product_id,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER(
      PARTITION BY members.customer_id
      ORDER BY sales.order_date) AS row_num
  FROM dannys_diner.members
  JOIN dannys_diner.sales
    ON members.customer_id = sales.customer_id
    AND sales.order_date < members.join_date
)

SELECT 
  customer_id, 
  product_name 
FROM joined_as_member
JOIN dannys_diner.menu
  ON joined_as_member.product_id = menu.product_id
WHERE row_num = 1
ORDER BY customer_id ASC;
```

**Common Table Expression (CTE):**

- ```joined_as_member``` CTE identifies sales for members before their join date.
  -  It joins the ```members``` and ```sales``` tables based on ```customer_id```.
 -  Filters for sales where order_date is less than join_date (correct for identifying purchases before joining).
 -  Assigns a sequential number (```row_num```) to each sale record within each customer group (ordered by ```order_date```). Here's the slight change:
- We need the highest order number (latest purchase) before joining, not the first (lowest). We can achieve this by changing ```ORDER BY sales.order_date to ORDER BY sales.order_date DESC```.
   **Main Query (remains unchanged):**

- Selects ```customer_id``` and ```product_name``` from the ```joined_as_member``` CTE and ```menu``` table, respectively.
- Joins the CTE with the ```menu``` table using ```product_id``` to retrieve product names.
- Filters for rows where ```row_num = 1``` (selecting the latest purchase for each customer before joining).
- Orders the results by ```customer_id``` in ascending order.

**Result**
| customer_id	| product_name |
|-------------|--------------|
| A           | sushi        |
| B           | curry        |

----------------------------------------
**8.What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?**

```
SELECT 
  sales.customer_id, 
  COUNT(sales.product_id) AS total_items, 
  SUM(menu.price) AS total_sales
FROM dannys_diner.sales
JOIN dannys_diner.members
  ON sales.customer_id = members.customer_id
  AND sales.order_date < members.join_date
JOIN dannys_diner.menu
  ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
GROUP BY sales.customer_id
ORDER BY sales.customer_id;
```

**Joining Tables:**

- ```FROM dannys_diner.sales```: Specifies the ```sales``` table from the database schema.
- ```JOIN dannys_diner.members ON sales.customer_id = members.customer_id```: Joins the ```sales``` and ```members``` tables based on ```customer_id```. This ensures we only consider sales data for customers who eventually became members.
- ```AND sales.order_date < members.join_date```: Filters the joined data to include only sales that occurred before the customer's join date. This focuses on purchases made while they were not yet members.
- ```JOIN dannys_diner.menu ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id```: Joins the ```sales``` table with the ```menu``` table based on ```product_id``` to retrieve corresponding product prices for calculating total sales.
 **Grouping and Aggregating Data:**

- ```GROUP BY sales.customer_id```: Groups the results by ```customer_id```. This ensures separate calculations of total items and total sales for each member.
- ```COUNT(sales.product_id) AS total_items```: Counts the number of product IDs (number of items purchased) for each customer group.
- ```SUM(menu.price) AS total_sales```: Calculates the sum of ```menu.price``` (total amount spent) for each customer group based on their purchases before joining.
 **Ordering Results:**

- ```ORDER BY sales.customer_id```: Orders the final results by ```customer_id``` in ascending order, providing information for each member in a predictable order.

**Result**

|customer_id	| total_items	| total_sales |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| A          |	2	          | 25          |
| B          |	3	          | 40          |

**9.If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier - how many points would each customer have?**
```
WITH points_cte AS (
  SELECT 
    menu.product_id, 
    CASE
      WHEN product_id = 1 THEN price * 20
      ELSE price * 10
    END AS points
  FROM dannys_diner.menu
)

SELECT 
  sales.customer_id, 
  SUM(points_cte.points) AS total_points
FROM dannys_diner.sales
JOIN points_cte
  ON sales.product_id = points_cte.product_id
GROUP BY sales.customer_id
ORDER BY sales.customer_id;
```

Common Table Expression (CTE):
- ```points_cte``` CTE defines a named result set to calculate points based on product ID.
  -  It selects ```product_id``` and ```price``` from the ```menu``` table.
  -  The ```CASE``` statement assigns points based on a rule:
   -   Products with ```product_id = 1``` earn double points (```price * 20```).
   -   All other products earn regular points (```price * 10```).
Main Query:
- Selects ```customer_id``` from the ```sales``` table and ```SUM(points_cte.points)``` as total_points.
- Joins the ```sales``` table with the ```points_cte``` CTE on ```product_id``` to associate points with each sale.
- ```GROUP BY sales.customer_id```: Groups the results by customer, ensuring the total points are calculated for each individual.
- ```ORDER BY sales.customer_id```: Orders the final results by ```customer_id``` in ascending order.

**Results**
|customer_id	|total_points |
|------------|-------------|
| A          |	860         |
| B          |	940         |
| C          |	360         |

----------------------------------

**10.In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi - how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?**
 ```
WITH dates_cte AS (
  SELECT 
    customer_id, 
    join_date, 
    join_date + 6 AS valid_date, 
    DATE_TRUNC(
      'month', '2021-01-31'::DATE)
      + interval '1 month' 
      - interval '1 day' AS last_date
  FROM dannys_diner.members
)

SELECT 
  sales.customer_id, 
  SUM(CASE
    WHEN menu.product_name = 'sushi' THEN 2 * 10 * menu.price
    WHEN sales.order_date BETWEEN dates.join_date AND dates.valid_date THEN 2 * 10 * menu.price
    ELSE 10 * menu.price END) AS points
FROM dannys_diner.sales
JOIN dates_cte AS dates
  ON sales.customer_id = dates.customer_id
  AND sales.order_date <= dates.last_date
JOIN dannys_diner.menu
  ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
GROUP BY sales.customer_id;
```

**Common Table Expression (CTE):**

- ```dates_cte``` CTE defines calculations related to join dates and valid periods.
- Selects relevant columns from the ```members``` table.
- ```join_date + 6 AS valid_date```: Calculates the end date of the first week after joining (assuming a 7-day week).
- ```DATE_TRUNC('month', '2021-01-31'::DATE) + interval '1 month' - interval '1 day' AS last_date```: This calculates the last day of January 2021. We use DATE_TRUNC to get the first day of the month, then add a month and subtract a day to get the last day.
**Main Query:**

- Selects ```customer_id``` and calculates total points with a ```SUM``` and a ```CASE``` statement.
- Joins the ```sales``` table with the ```dates_cte``` CTE on ```customer_id``` to associate join dates and valid periods with each sale.
- Filters the joined data using ```sales.order_date <= dates.last_date``` to ensure only sales within January 2021 are considered.
- Joins the ```sales``` table with the ```menu``` table on ```product_id``` to retrieve product prices.
- The ```CASE``` statement assigns points based on conditions:
- Double points for sushi purchases (```menu.product_name = 'sushi'```).
- Double points during the first week after joining (```sales.order_date BETWEEN dates.join_date AND dates.valid_date```).
- Regular points (10 points per dollar) for all other cases.
- ```GROUP BY sales.customer_id```: Groups the results by customer, ensuring separate point calculations for each.

  **Result**
|customer_id |	points|
|------------|-------|
| A          |	1370  |
| B          |	820   |

-----------------------------------
